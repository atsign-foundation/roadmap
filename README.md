# Roadmap

The place where we store our product roadmaps.

## Requesting Features & Products

This repository is used to store our public product roadmap items. You can find our public product roadmaps under the [Projects tab](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/roadmap/projects).
To request a new feature or product, you can [file an issue with this repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/roadmap/issues/new), or if you know the repo of the corresponding project, please file it there.
If there is a feature or product request that already exists and interests you, please let us know! It helps us prioritize the things that are important to community members like you!
